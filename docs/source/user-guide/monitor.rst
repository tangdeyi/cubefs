Monitor
-----------------------

ChubaoFS use prometheus as metrics collector. It simply config as follow in master, metanode, datanode, client's config file：

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "exporterPort": 9505,
       "consulAddr": "http://consul.prometheus-cfs.local",
       "consulMeta": "k1=v1;k2=v2",
       "ipFilter": "10.17.*",
       "enablePid": "false"
   }


* exporterPort：prometheus exporter Port. when set, can export prometheus metrics from URL(http://$hostip:$exporterPort/metrics). If not set, prometheus exporter will unavailable；
* consulAddr: consul register address, it can work with prometheus to auto discover deployed ChubaoFS nodes, if not set, consul register will not work.
* consulMeta: conusl meta config, not necessary, it can set meta info when register to consul.
* ipFilter: it's a ip regular filter, exposed to consul, not necessary, default empty, which is used for multiple ip machine. it can support positive or negative filter, for example:
    * ipFilter="10.17.*", means that ip, regular match ipFilter, is ok
    * ipFilter="!10.17.*" means that ip, not regular match ipFilter, is ok
* enablePid: whether to report partition id, default false; if you want to show dp or mp info in your cluster, you can set it true

Using grafana as prometheus metrics web front：

Also, user can use prometheus alertmanager to capture and route alerts to the correct receiver. please visit prometheus alertmanger `web-doc <https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/>`_

Metrics
>>>>>>>>>

- Cluster

    + The number of nodes:  ``MasterCount`` , ``MetaNodeCount`` , ``DataNodeCount`` , ``ObjectNodeCount``
    + The number of clients: ``ClientCount``
    + The number of volumes: ``VolumeCount``
    + The size of nodes: ``DataNodeSize`` , ``MetaNodeSize``
    + The used ratio of nodes: ``DataNodeUsedRatio`` , ``MetaNodeUsedRatio``
    + The number of inactive nodes: ``DataNodeInactive`` , ``MetaNodesInactive``
    + The capacity of volumes: ``VolumeTotalSize``
    + The used ratio of volumes: ``VolumeUsedRatio``
    + The number of error disks: ``DiskError``

- Volume

    + The used size of volumes: ``VolumeUsedSize``
    + The used ratio of volumes: ``VolumeUsedRatio``
    + The capacity change rate of volumes: ``VolumeSizeRate``

- Master

    + The number of invalid masters: ``master_nodes_invalid``
    + The number of invalid metanodes: ``metanode_inactive``
    + The number of invalid datanodes:： ``datanode_inactive``
    + The number of invalid clients:： ``fuseclient_inactive``

- MetaNode

    + The duration of each operation (Time) and the number of operations per second (Ops) on the metanode, which can be selected from the ``MetaNodeOp`` drop-down list.

- DataNode

    + The duration of each operation (Time) and the number of operations per second (Ops) on the datanode, which can be selected from the ``DataNodeOp`` drop-down list.

- ObjectNode

    + The duration of each operation (Time) and the number of operations per second (Ops) on the objectnode, which can be selected from the ``objectNodeOp`` drop-down list.

- FuseClient

    + The duration of each operation (Time) and the number of operations per second (Ops) on the client, which can be selected from the ``fuseOp`` drop-down list.

*Recommended focus metrics: cluster status, node or disk failure, total size, growth rate, etc.*
